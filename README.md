I created the code system powering the <a href="https://xandra3d.com">Xandra Character Creator</a> for use with Unreal Engine 5.
<br><br>

Features:
  - Create, save and re-use NPC appearances with ease, directly within the Unreal Engine editor.
  - Allow players to create and customise their in-game heroes.
